## Data

The salary information dataset was extracted from [ai-jobs.net](https://ai-jobs.net/salaries/download/)

The geo-location dataset was extracted from the following [GitHub repo](https://gist.github.com/tadast/8827699)

```{r download-data, include=FALSE }
library(tidyverse)

salary_data <- read_csv('data/salaries.csv')

map_data <- read_csv('data/countries_codes_and_coordinates.csv')

```

## Data Wrangling

```{r}

merged_df <- merge(salary_data, map_data, 
                   by.x = "company_location",
                   by.y = "Alpha-2 code",
                   all.x = TRUE)


# save merged file in data directory
write.csv(merged_df, 'data/merged_salaries.csv')

# check we still have 70 unique countries
length(unique(merged_df$company_location))

# summarize the dataset
summary(merged_df)
```
