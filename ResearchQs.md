The team behind the app targets one main groups of users of DS-Salaries. This group consists of Data Science professionals or aspiring professionals who are looking for employment or to switch careers in the sector.
A typical user from group one would be represented by the following description:

Jane is currently pursuing a degree in Data Science and is exploring career opportunities in the field.  She has spoken to several recruiters from different companies.  The positions Jane has discussed have varying job titles and responsibilities.  Because this would be her first job post graduation, Jane wants to make the best career choice.  She wants a job where she can learn fast, but she also wants to maximize her financial well being.  That is why Jane is conducting independent research on salary levels in the industry and is evaluating salary levels associated with different job titles. As a Data Scientist Jane understands that trend is important, which is why one aspect of salaries she is looking at is how they have changed over the past couple of years.  Furthermore, she wants to understand which jobs offer the best salary upside with growing experience, so Jane is researching experience related salary data.  Finally, because this is her first job, Jane would be willing to relocate in order to maximize her earning potential if everything else is equal, therefore she wants to know about salary levels in different locations.

The DS-Salaries app will give Jane the information she needs and will provide a great benchmark for her forthcoming salary discussions once she gets multiple job offers.  When she loads the app, Jane will be able to find information about salary trends, experience-dependent salary levels, pay levels depending on job titles and salary levels based on specific geography.  Furthermore the app will provide her with functionality to evaluate the data for specific year, job location, company size and experience level.
